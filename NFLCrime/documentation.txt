Steps:

0. Create a GitHUB repository for solution

Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/nomisabi/test-assignment

1. Setup a new Angular site

I cloned GitHUB repository and created a new Angular project with NFLCrime title. 
Versions:
Angular CLI: 8.3.22
Node: 13.6.0
OS: darwin x64
Angular: 8.2.14

2. Add external data services

I created the services, added an error hadling function and a function to get values with Http requests.

3. Add components to show data from services

Deleted some parts of the basic HTML app and added navigation to it. I created the three components, 
and paths to these components in routing file. I installed Material. I created interfaces for crimes, teams and players.
I coded HTML for the components with Material Table and Select.
In Top Crimes, I call the service in ngOnInit to get all of the top crimes. In the other two, first I call the the service in ngOnInit to get all of the top crimes,
and when one of the crime is selected, then it called the service to get the top players and teams.
